## The Setup
This project was made with Unity 2020.3.26f1 (64-bit) on a Lenovo Legion 5 pro laptop. To follow 
along you will need a blank Unity3D Project

## Description
In this Project I intended to take a closer look at a few different ways one can generate spheres. There are four main sphere generation algorithms that were taken into consideration for this project. 
Before I began implementing any of them, I considered my current understood of the spheres benefits and drawbacks. From there I selected two of the best candidates for the job at hand – generating a procedural planet – and move on to implementation. I looked at multiple ways the sphere algorithms could be implemented and consider pros and cons for the different methods. I then will consider each implementation and decide which are the best suited for the job.
In the end I hoped to answer “which sphere generation algorithm lends itself best for procedural planet generation?”

For the implementation I used Unity3D for ease of visualization.
